# TonUINO NFC Tools

Android app to write and read NFC tags that can be used on the [TonUINO DIY music box](https://tonuino.de/).

For discussion, see [this thread (in German)](http://discourse.voss.earth/t/android-app-um-tonuino-karten-zu-beschreiben/2151), or use github issues.

The app is available [for download on github](https://github.com/marc136/tonuino-nfc-tools/releases), 
installable using the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.mw136.tonuino) or the [F-Droid Store](https://f-droid.org/packages/de.mw136.tonuino/).

The github releases are built on [CircleCI ![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/marc136/tonuino-nfc-tools/tree/main.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/marc136/tonuino-nfc-tools/tree/main).  
Google Play releases are built using [fastlane](https://docs.fastlane.tools/getting-started/android/setup/).

## Getting started

Install [Android studio](https://developer.android.com/studio#downloads), and then [run this app on a real Android device](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/running-app#RealDevice).

If you want more control check the docs on [building](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/building-cmdline) and [testing](https://developer.android.com/studio/test/command-line) from cli.

Follow the instructions on how to [run apps on a real hardware Android device](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/device).

These are a few commands I find useful:

```sh
# Create a clean build
./gradlew clean bundle

# If something fails, check the output of
./gradlew --version

# Run the linter
./gradlew lint

# Run the test suite with
./gradlew test
# Or
bundle exec fastlane test

# Deploy a debug build to a connected Android device
./gradlew installDebug

# Check if the Android device was properly connected
./gradlew connectedCheck

# Get a list of available gradle tasks
./gradlew tasks
```

## TODO
- [ ] Migrate away from deprecated `kotlin-android-extensions` plugin
> Warning: The 'kotlin-android-extensions' Gradle plugin is deprecated. Please use this migration guide (https://goo.gle/kotlin-android-extensions-deprecation) to start working with View Binding (https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding) and the 'kotlin-parcelize' plugin.
    - [ ] Recreate the UI with [Jetpack compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose)
    - [ ] Use KTX extension libs https://developer.android.com/kotlin/ktx
- [ ] Replace qr code scanner lib as it is no longer maintained
- [ ] Get BytesFormatter to work without issues
- [ ] Hide on-screen-keyboard when switching between edit fragments
- [ ] Allow users to write a note or title to the NFC tag
- [ ] Allow users to keep a list of tags
- [ ] Simulate NFC tag
- [ ] Use proper Material design theming instead of faking it
    - On MainActivity if NFC is not available

## Tonuino TNG 3.1.x
[Repository](https://github.com/tonuino/TonUINO-TNG#version-31-13102022)

Is a full rewrite of the original TonUINO software in C++ 

**Different Modes**  
It supports all modes of TonUINO 2.1 and adds these

| #  | title           | description                                               | next | previous                              |
|----|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|------|---------------------------------------|
| 10 | Hörbuch Einzeln | Play the next file from the folder and store the progress | stop | start title again from the beginning  |
| 11 | Repeat last     | Repeat the last card or shortcut                          | ??   | ??                                    |

Wiederhole Karte Modus: die letzte Karte oder der letzte Shortcut wird wiederholt.

#### Modifier Tags (aka admin tags)
Same as TonUINO 2.1 but removed the `FeedbackModifier` card with value `7`.

## NFC Host Card Emulation
It would be great if the app also can act as an NFC tag to simulate TonUINO tags, some links to this:
[Official Android docs](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/nfc/hce.html#HCE)

From a [question on Mifare support forum](https://www.mifare.net/support/forum/topic/creating-nfc-android-app-to-act-as-mifare-card-to-interact-with-mifare-readers/):
>  Here is a very good example https://github.com/grundid/host-card-emulation-sample which will write to you "Hello Desktop!" The App emulates a MIFARE card with this AID 0xF0, 0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04, 0x05, 0x06 You should make your self familiar with the HCE code.
>
> In the other side you should have an NFC reader (in your case MIFARE NFC) which will be looking for the same AID as in the HCE App. Normally you should send this cmd to the Android phone from your reader after you have brought the two devices close enough 0x00 [CLA], 0xA4 [INS], 0x04, 0x00, 0x07 [Lc], 0xF0, 0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04, 0x05, 0x06, 0x00 [Le]
